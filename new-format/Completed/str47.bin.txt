Levi
----0001----
You're taking care of
the flower bed at this time?

~---------------------------------------
Ashley
----0002----
What's your deal? I don't have anything
to say to you. Leave me alone

~---------------------------------------
Levi
----0003----
Don't be like that.
I don't want to get into a fight.

~---------------------------------------
Ashley
----0004----
……

~---------------------------------------
Levi
----0005----
These roses is really pretty…

~---------------------------------------
Ashley
----0006----
You think that you can understand
the beauty of flowers?

~---------------------------------------
Levi
----0007----
It's not my specialty or anything, but…

~---------------------------------------
Levi
----0008----
But don't you see just how well these
roses have been kept in good condition?

~---------------------------------------
Ashley
----0009----
Well then, what do you think
when you see these roses?$e3
~---------------------------------------
Ashley
----0010----
If you only have such superficial
ideas, then you're way off.

~---------------------------------------
Levi
----0011----
What do you mean I'm way off?

~---------------------------------------
Ashley
----0012----
Beauty is an essence in and of itself.

~---------------------------------------
Ashley
----0013----
If you can't see that essence, then
you're way off being a Magi Knight.

~---------------------------------------
Levi
----0014----
Hey, why does the competence of a Magi
have to be measured against roses?

~---------------------------------------
Ashley
----0015----
In the heart… These roses certainly
stay in a lot of people's hearts.

~---------------------------------------
Levi
----0016----
It's not just you and your brother?

~---------------------------------------
Ashley
----0017----
Yes.

~---------------------------------------
Ashley
----0018----
With many generations of breeding, There
is finally something to represent him.

~---------------------------------------
Ashley
----0019----
It's a crystal of passion

~---------------------------------------
Levi
----0020----
……

~---------------------------------------
Ashley
----0021----
It's not much to look at

~---------------------------------------
Ashley
----0022----
But I think that the true beauty is
the passion that lies inside.

~---------------------------------------
Levi
----0023----
The passion inside?

~---------------------------------------
Ashley
----0024----
Just like knights. Our strength comes
from the power of our inner thoughts.

~---------------------------------------
Ashley
----0025----
So Levi, What do you think
is the beauty of the knights?$e3
~---------------------------------------
Ashley
----0026----
Self Sacrifice…
That's a pretty common answer.

~---------------------------------------
Levi
----0027----
Well what else should I have said?
Their naked bodies?

~---------------------------------------
Ashley
----0028----
You're such an idiot. Didn't I say
that passion was the true beauty?

~---------------------------------------
Levi
----0029----
Well then, why don't you show passion
for something other than the rules?

~---------------------------------------
Ashley
----0030----
…！？

~---------------------------------------
Levi
----0031----
The rules are important, but there
is something else more important.

~---------------------------------------
Levi
----0032----
If you noticed it,
do you think you'd change?

~---------------------------------------
Ashley
----0033----
What would you know about that?
It's none of your business!

~---------------------------------------
Ashley
----0034----
Are you an idiot!?

~---------------------------------------
Levi
----0035----
Why do you say that? isn't the beauty
in the body under all the armor?

~---------------------------------------
Ashley
----0036----
That's not it at all!

~---------------------------------------
Levi
----0037----
Well for the heart… Surely you'd have
to collide naked to truly get close?

~---------------------------------------
Ashley
----0038----
…！？

~---------------------------------------
Levi
----0039----
To me, it seems like you're wearing
armor around your heart

~---------------------------------------
Ashley
----0040----
Y-you!

~---------------------------------------
Levi
----0041----
What? Did I hit the mark?

~---------------------------------------
Ashley
----0042----
I can't take this anymore! You're just
piling on insults! I'll fight you here!

~---------------------------------------
Levi
----0043----
Bring it on! I'm going to settle…

~---------------------------------------
Levi
----0044----

----0045----

to go on dormitory patrol…

Oh…

~---------------------------------------
Kate
----0048----

~---------------------------------------
ケイト
----0049----
Ashley's virgin breasts have been
defiled by this filthy beast's claws!

~---------------------------------------
Levi
----0050----
N- No! This isn't what it looks like!

~---------------------------------------
Ashley
----0051----
How dare you!

~---------------------------------------
Levi
----0052----
Ouch!
